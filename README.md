# sayama-networkx-2

Code for the networks chapters in Sayama's _Introduction to the
Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems_, updated for the networkx
2.x library.

The textbook was written when networkx 1.x was still standard.
Unfortunately the textbook code does not work with breaking
changes in the now standard networkx 2.x.
